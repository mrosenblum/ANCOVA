# Jarskog, L. F., R. M. Hamer, D. J. Catellier, D. D. Stewart, L. LaVange, N. Ray, 
# L. H.Golden, J. A. Lieberman, and T. S. Stroup (2013). Metformin for weight loss 
# andmetabolic control in overweight outpatients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective 
# disorder.American Journal of Psychiatry  170(9), 1032â€“1040.
# 
# set the current directory to be this folder and run the following code
# output a cleaned data set with variable:
#   subject_id: id of each subject
#   age:  age of each subject in month,
#   gender: an indicator with 1 indicating female, 0 indicating male,
#   treatment: "Metformin" or "Placebo"
#   CGI: CGI (Clinical Global Impressions severity score) score measured at baseline
#   weight_baseline: weight (pound) measured at baseline
#   weight_16: weight measured at week 16
#   weightchange: weight_16 - weight_baseline
#   height: height (inch) measured at baseline
#   tobacco: level of using tobacoo
#   alcohol: level of using alcohol
#   drug: level of using drug
#   bmi: BMI index calculated using weight_baseline and height
